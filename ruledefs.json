Every unit, weapon, upgrade, and Magic Item has a specific point cost, which is used to balance the game and ensure fair play between players.<br><br>\tPlanning, strategy, knowing terrain, learning about the ponent – very useful for a heist!

Each Army Category has its own points limit, as defined in the Army Book, determining how many points a player can allocate to that particular category. This allows players to create a balanced and strategic army composition for their games.<br><br>\t<br>\t<br>\t<br><br>characterCharactersThis category typically allows players to spend up to 40% of the Army Size. All entries that belong to this Category follow the rules for Characters and Attachable Models.Characters are the leaders and exceptional individuals in the army, wielding various skills such as brute force, tactical acumen, spellcasting ability, or engineering knowledge. They play a crucial role in influencing the outcome of battles, and one of them usually  serves as the army's General, responsible for leading and inspiring your forces.<br><br>coreCoreThis Army Category always has a minimum amount of points that must be spent on it, usually 25% of the Army Size.<br><br>Core units represent the most readily available warriors in the faction, serving as essential rank-and-file troops under the command of the Characters. They are always present in some combination as part of your fighting force.specialSpecialThis Army Category has no maximum or minimum limit. You are free to spend any amount of points on units in this Category.<br><br>The Special Army Category represents less common and more unique forces that are found in some but not all of your faction's armies. While they might make up the largest portion of your host, , the availability of each unit is still limited. They can often fill a range of useful and impactful roles.<br><br>EoSArmy-SpecificThis Army Category has a maximum amount of points that can be spent on it; the limit is defined within individual Army Books.<br><br>Army-Specific Categories introduce additional options and limitations in army building, reflecting the nature of the faction. Army-Specific Categories can include thematic groupings of units, limitations based on specific functions, and sometimes the faction’s most rare and powerful forces.<br><br><h5>Belonging to more than one Army Category</h5><br>Some units can be included in more than one Army Category, which is represented by more than one icon in their entry. In these cases, simply count the unit’s Point Cost towards the limits of all its Army Categories, but only once towards the army’s Point Cost.<br><br><h5>Adding Army Categories to a Unit</h5><br>Choosing certain options can make a unit count towards another Army Category in addition to its original Army Category. For example, giving a unit Shooting Weapons might make it also count towards the Ranged Support Army Category. This is marked by a small icon of the additional Army Category, displayed underneath the original Army Category icon(s), together with the conditions for counting towards this additional Army Category.<br><br><h5>Splitting Point Cost between Army Categories</h5><br>In some rare cases, a unit’s Point Cost can be split between different Army Categories, where the Point Cost for some particular option is additionally counted towards a different Army Category than the unit. This is marked in the unit entry by a split icon, with the two halves representing the two Army Categories the unit counts towards.<br><br><i>For example, a 250 pts Elf Character, counted towards the Characters Army Category, decides to ride a 500 pts Dragon, which is an option marked to count additionally towards Beasts and Monsters. In this case, the player must count the entire unit’s Point Cost (250 + 500 = 750 pts) towards Characters, and the Dragon’s Point Cost (500 pts) towards “Beasts and Monsters”. Here too, of course, only 750 pts are added towards the army’s total limit.</i><br><br><h5>Rarity - Restrictions for Units and Items</h5><br><br>Certain units and options in the army have limitations on how many times they can be included.<br><br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Maximum Points cost</span>: Unless mentioned otherwise, no unit can have a points cost above 600 points.  A unit entry with a different maximum points cost different than this, follows its own defined limits instead. <i>For example, a unit with (max. 800 pts) listed next to its unit size limits can cost up to 800 points.</i><br><br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Max. X Items per Army</span>: Some items have an amount of Max. X allowed per army. <i>For example, it might be Max. 2 Units, Max. 2 Models, or Max. 2 Mounts per Army.

Unless noted otherwise, all units taken from Core are Regular.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Common</span>: These items are limited to a maximum of once per 1000 Army Points, rounding fractions up. <i>For example, at 4000 Army Points Regular items are restricted to Max. 4 per Army</i>. Unless noted otherwise, all units taken from outside Core are Common.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Uncommon</span>: These items are limited to a maximum of once per 1500 Army Points, rounding fractions up. <i>For example, at 4000 Army Points Regular items are restricted to Max. 3 per Army</i>.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Rare</span>: These items are limited to a maximum of once per 2500 Army Points, rounding fractions up. <i>For example, at 4000 Army Points Regular items are restricted to Max. 2 per Army</i>.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Extraordinary</span>: These items are limited to a maximum of once per 5000 Army Points, rounding fractions up. <i>For example, at 4000 Army Points Regular items are restricted to Max. 1 per Army</i>.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Legendary</span>: These items can only be taken once per army.<br>\t<br>\t<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Max.

In every battle he munches up armies with big, dreadfullest <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/spells\">spells</nuxt-link>.<br>One day he decides to visit special lovely Garden of law-biding goblins.

And when he heats his water for a bath, she sends the magic off, so he has to wash cold. When he makes the broom come to life to clean his chamber, she makes it stumble and fall down. Madder and madder, finally he tries biggest spell he knows. Clever goblin lets it go, and the magic shakes the whole tower into rubble, with the nasty wizard inside, squished.

Most warriors combine to form disciplined regiments called units, and several such units form the  foundation of your army.</i><h5>Model</h5> A single gaming piece placed on a base. Each model has its own profile, which consists of a statline of values, model rules, and equipment. The profile reflects the capabilities of the model.<br><br><h5>Rank-and-File model</h5> Normal models in a unit. All models, except Attachable Models (<i>such as all Characters</i>), are referred to as Rank-and-File models.<br><br><h5>Base</h5> The platform on which a playing piece rests. Bases are rectangular and represent the area of the battlefield occupied by the model. In the game rules, the base is the only physical aspect of the model that matters. Bases are measured in front-width × side-length, e.g., 25×50 mm for most horse riders.<br><br><h5>Unit</h5> A group of one or more models that operate as a single entity, arranged in a rectangular formation. Models in a unit move and fight together, coordinating their actions on the battlefield.<br><br>When forming a unit of multiple models, the following conditions must be met to form a viable formation;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The models are placed in a tight rectangular formation and facing the same direction.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The unit cannot voluntarily have more Ranks than Files unless the unit is wide enough to have a Proper Rank.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  For units that are always considered to have 0 Proper Ranks, such as units with Light Troops, apply this rule as if they could form Proper Ranks (<i>e.g. a Height 1 units with Light Troop cannot have more ranks than files unless at least 5 models wide</i>).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  Note that joining a unit with a Character is considered a voluntary action.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The models are perfectly aligned and in contact with each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The width of the unit is determined by the first frontmost rank. No models may extend past this width.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  Models not in the first rank must be positioned so that another model is directly in front of them, ensuring the entire front edge of their bases are in contact with the models in front of them.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  All ranks within a unit must have the same width, except for the rear rank, which can be narrower.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  It is acceptable for the rear rank to have gaps, as long as the models are aligned with those in the other ranks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  An Incomplete Rank refers to a rank with one or more missing models.<br><br>When a rule, ability, spell, or any other effect affects a unit, all models of the unit are affected, unless explicitly stated otherwise.<br><br><h5>Unit Boundary</h5> The Unit Boundary is an imaginary rectangle encompassing the outer edges of a unit.

The rear rank is incomplete and only contains 4 models. The Front, Flank, and Rear Arcs are defined by drawing lines from the corners of the Unit Boundary at a 135  angle from the unit’s Facings.\\<br>b) The Unit Boundary is the area drawn around the outer edges of the unit, shaded red lines. The Centre of the unit is the centre of the Unit Boundary. \\<br>c) A Unit Boundary cannot be inside another Unit Boundary, not even with parts that are not occupied by any models.<br><br><h5>Proper Ranks</h5> The number of models required to form a Proper Rank depends on the unit's Height:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  5 models for Height 0-2, <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  3 models for Height 3-4, and<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  1 model for Height 5.<br><br><h5>Ranks and Files</h5> Lines of models in the same unit that are side by side are called ranks, and lines of models that are directly in front and behind each other are called files.<br><br><h5>Model Parts</h5> Some models have multiple lines of Offensive Profiles. Each line represents a different Model Part.<br><br><i>For example, a Cavalry model consists of a rider and its mount.

After nine long ages of strife, the many peoples and kingdoms of this high fantasy world have acquired highly developed and often spectacular methods of waging war. With so many great and terrible powers throughout the lands, the future is poised and uncertain: Everything could be decided on the outcome of a single battle.<br><br>For the reader who wishes to delve deeper into the lore of the Ninth Age, you can discover more of the wider setting in each Army Book, as well as our background-focused publications: <a href='https://www.the-ninth-age.com/the-world/'>the-ninth-age.com/the-world</a>.<br><br>Among the various cultures, countries, and strange dominions of the world, sixteen great factions are pre-eminent. Each of these powers represents a terrifying military force. Each will attempt to dominate the Ninth Age as they are able, and each has connections that can bring it across the globe. As such, there is never any shortage of reasons for conflict and battle between these mighty armies - as your tabletop games can testify.<br><br>1214.4Few individuals have the chance to see more than a fraction of our world, with its astonishing variety of intelligent races and animal species, plants and cities, cults and wars. I have travelled from Avras to the Kingdom of Vanhu. I’ve seen Sunna’s seeds planted in Virentia and the Great Wall of Tsuandan in the far east of Augea. You could not find another who has travelled a greater distance; I have been protected by the auspice of Sunna, and here I record my knowledge on the geography of our world.<br>Vetia is the land of mankind, where nations of men have reigned for years under the protective sight of the Goddess and her church. There, the powerful nation of Sonnstahl guards all mankind against the dangers of the Wasteland, while to the south the merchant cities of Arcalea ply their trade with the whole of the world. There you will also find the White Mountains, impenetrable hold of the Dwarves. To the west lie the twin cities of Destria, the Kingdom of noble Equitaine, and the enchanted, emerald-green forest of Wyscan, the mysterious dwelling of the sylvan elves.    Augea, the immense sister of Vetia, separated from one another by the great Wasteland, home to the servants of the Dark Gods. Crossing east of Avras into this land, you will travel through the Barren Mountains, where the Steel Road starts its winding journey. Here is the dwelling of the Dwarves of the east, named Infernal. The Steel Road runs parallel to the Silk Road to the north, with access controlled by the Ogre Khans. It leads from the Blasted Plains through the Sky Mountains, across the northern part of the human region of Sagarikadesha, finishing its rich path in the glorious land of Tsuandan, where the Dragon Emperor rules over men.<br>Set sail south from Bellatorre, and in three nights you will reach the docks of Port Reynaud, Equitaine’s holdfast in Taphria. Should you dare it, you will never forget the nights spent in the Great Desert, for they are terrible and fascinating all at once. There, following the path of the Napaat river, lie the remains of a truly ancient kingdom with its legends of never-dying monstrosities. In the west stand the fortresses and souks of Qassar, full of exotic smells and tales of evil spirits, the djinn. In the west and southeast of the continent lie vast kingdoms of men; the Koghi Empire and Kingdom of Vanhu respectively. Finally in its south, the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/forests\">forests</nuxt-link> around the Mfumu river are said to hide some of the most ancient secrets of the world.<br>The Great Ocean divides Vetia from the two western continents, Silexia in the north and Virentia in the south. The Ocean itself is the dominion of elves: there the fleets of the two great nations, the Highborn and their dreaded kin, vie for supremacy. Here lies the main motherland of the Highborn Elves, the proud islands of Celeda Ablan, and Silexia where freedom is a commodity to be traded.<br>On the eastern coast of Virentia mankind too, has established colonies: the imperial city of Fredericksberg, and the port of Aguadulce, of Destria. Beyond them, a lush forest of wonderful colors and inconceivable dan- gers hides the secrets of ancient civilizations.
