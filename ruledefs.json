Forward Ahead</i>). If it is not possible to perform this Post-combat <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/pivot\">Pivot</nuxt-link> in a way that puts the unit in a legal end position, instead treat the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/table_edge\">Table Edge</nuxt-link> as an Obstruction*, see below.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Obstruction</span>*: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit would be in <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/contact\">contact</nuxt-link> with an obstruction*, the unit instead <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/pivot\">Pivots</nuxt-link> so that it faces a direction as close as possible towards the same direction that the Pursued unit is facing, while following the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</nuxt-link> rule (<i>normally this means stopping 1\" away from the obstruction*</i>). The unit moves no further (<i>i.e. ignore step 2.

The <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</nuxt-link> rule is ignored when doing this check and for all movement during Forward Ahead. If more than one is applicable, apply the uppermost one.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Enemy unit</span>: If the first obstacle would be the Unit Boundary of an enemy unit that did not Flee from the same combat, the Pursuing unit declares a Charge against that unit using its Pursuit Distance roll as its <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/charge_range\">Charge Range</nuxt-link>. If there is more than one possible target, the Pursuing unit chooses which to Charge. The Charged unit may not perform any <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/charge_reactions\">Charge Reactions</nuxt-link>. The Pursuing unit immediately performs a <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/charge_move\">Charge Move</nuxt-link>  towards the previously determined Facing, following all the normal <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/charge_move\">Charge Move</nuxt-link> and Align described in the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/charge_phase\">Charge Phase</nuxt-link> chapter. If the Charge is not possible to complete, the unit does not perform a <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/failed_charge_move\">Failed Charge Move</nuxt-link> but treats the enemy unit as obstruction* instead, see below.<br><br>If the Pursuing unit joins a combat that has already been fought or was created during this <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/melee_phase\">Melee Phase</nuxt-link>, it will be resolved in the next <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/melee_phase\">Melee Phase</nuxt-link>, with the Charging unit still counting as Charging. If the Pursuing unit joins a combat that wasn’t created during this <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/melee_phase\">Melee Phase</nuxt-link> and that hasn’t been fought yet, the unit will have a chance to fight and Pursue again this phase.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\"><nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/table_edge\">Table Edge</nuxt-link></span>: If the first obstacle would be the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/table_edge\">Table Edge</nuxt-link>, move the unit straight forward until it touches the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/table_edge\">Table Edge</nuxt-link>, and then perform a Post-combat <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/pivot\">Pivot</nuxt-link>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Obstruction</span>* <span class=\"textbf\">or no Obstacle</span>:  If the first obstacle, if any, would not be an enemy Unit Boundary or the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/table_edge\">Table Edge</nuxt-link>, the Pursuing unit now moves its Pursuit Distance straight forward. If this brings the Front Facing of the unit into base <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/contact\">contact</nuxt-link> with an obstruction*, the unit stops just before entering base <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/contact\">contact</nuxt-link>.<br><br><h5>3. Legal Position?</h5><br>At the end of the Pursue Move, check if the unit is in a legal position. It cannot be in <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/contact\">contact</nuxt-link> with a unit it didn’t declare a Charge against, and it must follow the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</nuxt-link> rule, which includes friendly units that were part of the same combat. If the unit is not in a legal position, backtrack the move to the unit’s last legal position where it follows the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</nuxt-link> rule.<br><br><nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/impassable_terrain\">*Impassable Terrain</nuxt-link>, enemy units that Fled from the combat involving the Pursuing unit, and friendly units that were not part of that combat are considered to be obstructions for the Pursuit Move.<br><br>Example of two units<br>Pursuing into the same enemy unit.a) Unit D loses the combat, Breaks, and Flees 7\". The owner of the winning units chooses to roll for unit A’s Pursuit Distance first. 6\" is not enough to catch the Fleeing unit. Unit B’s Pursuit Distance is 7\", so it is equal to or higher than unit D’s Flee Distance: the Fleeing unit is immediately destroyed. Unit C's Pursuit Distance is 5\".<br>b) When checking which units will Charge an enemy unit during their Pursuit, before moving any Pursuing unit, it turns out that both unit A and unit B will Charge unit E, so both units declare a Charge against unit E. Unit C will not Charge any enemy units.<br>c) Now units A and B perform their Pursuit Moves first. During this move, they can move through one another ignoring the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</nuxt-link> rule.

Each model has its own profile, which consists of a statline of values, model rules, and equipment. The profile reflects the capabilities of the model.<br><br><h5>Base</h5> The platform on which a playing piece rests. Bases are rectangular and represent the area of the battlefield occupied by the model. In the game rules, the base is the only physical aspect of the model that matters. Bases are measured in front-width × side-length, e.g., 25×50 mm for most horse riders.<br><br><h5>Unit</h5> A group of one or more models that operate as a single entity, arranged in a rectangular formation. Models in a unit move and fight together, coordinating their actions on the battlefield. When a rule, ability, spell, or any other effect affects a unit, all models of the unit are affected, unless explicitly stated otherwise. When forming a unit of multiple models, the following conditions must be met to form a viable formation;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The models are placed in a tight rectangular formation and facing the same direction.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The unit cannot voluntarily have more Ranks than Files unless the unit is wide enough to have a Proper Rank.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  For units that are always considered to have 0 Proper Ranks, such as units with Light Troops, apply this rule as if they could form Proper Ranks (<i>e.g. a Height 1 units with Light Troop cannot have more ranks than files unless at least 5 models wide</i>).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  Note that joining a unit with a Character is considered a voluntary action.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The models are perfectly aligned and in contact with each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The width of the unit is determined by the first frontmost rank. No models may extend past this width.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  Models not in the first rank must be positioned so that another model is directly in front of them, ensuring the entire front edge of their bases are in contact with the models in front of them.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  All ranks within a unit must have the same width, except for the rear rank, which can be narrower.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  It is acceptable for the rear rank to have gaps, as long as the models are aligned with those in the other ranks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  An Incomplete Rank refers to a rank with one or more missing models.<br><br><h5>Unit Boundary</h5> The Unit Boundary is an imaginary rectangle encompassing the outer edges of a unit. Unit cannot be inside another Unit Boundary, unless the units are explicitly allowed to temporarily be overlapping.<br><br><h5>The Centre of a unit</h5> A unit's centre is located at the centre of its Unit Boundary.<br><br><h5>Facings</h5> A unit or a model has four Facings that correspond to the edges of the Unit Boundary or the model’s base; a Front, a Rear, and two Flanks, .<br><br><h5>Arcs</h5> A unit’s Arcs correspond to the area in front of the four Facings, divided by a straight line extending from the corners of the Unit Boundary at a 135° angle from the unit’s Facings.<br><br><h5>Model Parts</h5> Some models have multiple lines of Offensive Profiles. Each line represents a different Model Part. <i>For example, a Cavalry model consists of a rider and its mount. If a rule, ability, spell, or effect affects a model, all model parts are affected unless stated otherwise. During attacks or shooting, each model part uses its own characteristics and weapons.</i><br><br><h5>Ranks and Files</h5> Lines of models in the same unit that are side by side are called ranks, and lines of models that are directly in front and behind each other are called files.<br><br>The number of models required to form a Proper Rank depends on the unit’s Height:<br><br>5 models for Height 0-2, <br>3 models for Height 3-4, and<br>1 model for Height 5.<br><br><h5>Friendly and Enemy</h5> The terms friendly and enemy are used to distinguish between units that belong to the same player (friendly units) and units controlled by opposing players (enemy units).<br><br>/subsection{maintaining_a_viable_formation}",

There, the powerful nation of Sonnstahl guards all mankind against the dangers of the Wasteland, while to the south the merchant cities of Arcalea ply their trade with the whole of the world.

Crossing east of Avras into this land, you will travel through the Barren Mountains, where the Steel Road starts its winding journey. Here is the dwelling of the Dwarves of the east, named Infernal. The Steel Road runs parallel to the Silk Road to the north, with access controlled by the Ogre Khans. It leads from the Blasted Plains through the Sky Mountains, across the northern part of the human region of Sagarikadesha, finishing its rich path in the glorious land of Tsuandan, where the Dragon Emperor rules over men.<br>Set sail south from Bellatorre, and in three nights you will reach the docks of Port Reynaud, Equitaine’s holdfast in Taphria.

There, following the path of the Napaat river, lie the remains of a truly ancient kingdom with its legends of never-dying monstrosities. In the west stand the fortresses and souks of Qassar, full of exotic smells and tales of evil spirits, the djinn.
