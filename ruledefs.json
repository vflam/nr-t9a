Each Army Category has its own Points Cost limit, as defined in the Army Book, determining how many Army Points a player can allocate to that particular category.<br>This allows players to create a balanced and strategic army composition for their games.<br><br>\t<br>\t<br>\t<br><br>characterCharactersAn army can typically spend up to 40% of its Army Points on characters.<br><br>All entries in this Category follow the rules for both Characters and Attachable Models.Characters are the leaders and exceptional individuals in the army, wielding various skills such as brute force, tactical acumen, spellcasting ability, or engineering knowledge. They play a crucial role in influencing the outcome of battles, and one of them usually  serves as the army’s General, responsible for leading and inspiring your forces.<br><br>coreCoreAn army must spend a minimum number of Army Points on this category generally 25%.<br><br>Core units represent the most readily available warriors in the faction, serving as essential rank-and-file troops under the command of the Characters. They are always present in some combination as part of your fighting force.<br><br>specialSpecialThis Army Category has no maximum limit. An army can spend any amount of Army Points on units in this Category.<br><br>The Special Army Category represents less common and more unique forces that are found in some but not all of your faction’s armies. While they might make up the largest portion of your host, the availability of each unit is still limited. They usually fill a range of useful and impactful roles.<br><br>EoSArmy-SpecificAn Army-Specific Category always has a maximum percentage of Army Points that can be spent on it; the limit is defined in the individual Army Books.<br><br>Army-Specific Categories introduce additional options and limitations in army building, reflecting the nature of the faction. Army-Specific Categories can include thematic groupings of units, limitations based on specific functions, and the faction’s most rare and powerful forces.<br><br><h5>Units belonging to more than one Army Category</h5><br>Some units can be included in more than one Army Category, which is represented by more than one icon in their entry. In these cases, simply count the unit’s Points Cost towards the limits of all its Army Categories, but only once towards the army’s Points Cost.<br><br><h5>Adding Army Categories to a Unit</h5><br>Choosing certain options can make a unit count towards another Army Category in addition to its original Army Category. For example, giving a unit Shooting Weapons might make it also count towards the Ranged Support Army Category.<br>This is marked by a small icon of the additional Army Category, displayed underneath the original Army Category icon(s), together with the conditions for counting towards this additional Army Category.<br><br><h5>Splitting Point Cost between Army Categories</h5><br>In a few cases, a unit’s Points Cost can be split between different Army Categories, where the Points Cost for some particular option is additionally counted towards a different Army Category than the unit. This is marked in the unit entry by a split icon, with the two halves representing the two Army Categories the unit counts towards.<br><br><i>For example, a 250 pts Elf Character, counted towards the Characters Army Category, decides to ride a 500 pts Dragon, which is an option marked to count additionally towards Beasts and Monsters. In this case, the player must count the entire unit’s Points Cost (250 + 500 = 750 pts) towards Characters, and the Dragon’s Points Cost (500 pts) towards Beasts and Monsters. Of course, only 750 pts are added towards the army’s total limit.</i><br><br><h5>Rarity – Restrictions for Units and Items</h5><br><br>All units and some options in the army have a limit on the number of times, that they can be included in the army.<br><br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Maximum Points Cost:</span> unless mentioned otherwise a unit can cost no more that 600 Army Points. Some Unit Entries have a different maximum Points Cost, this replaces the general limit.<br><i>For example, a unit with (max. 800 pts) listed next to its unit size limits can cost up to 800 points instead of 600</i>.<br><br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Max. X items per army:</span> some items have an amount of Max. X allowed per army. <i>Eg. Max. 20 bows, Max. 4 models. This means you can choose to include a maximum of X instances of each of these items in your army.</i><br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Regular:</span> these Unit Entries are limited to a maximum of one per 500 Army Points (rounding fractions up).<br><i>For example, at 4000 Army Points, Regular Unit Entries are restricted to Max. 8/army)</i>.<br>Generally units taken from the Core Army Category are Regular.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Common:</span> these items are limited to a maximum of one per 1000 Army Points (rounding fractions up).<br><i>For example, at 4000 Army Points, Common items are restricted to Max. 4/army)</i>.<br>This is the default limit for all Unit Entries.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Uncommon:</span> these items are limited to a maximum of one per 1500 Army Points (rounding fractions up).<br><i>For example, at 4000 Army Points, Uncommon items are restricted to Max. 3/army)</i>.<br>This is the least restrictive limit generally used on magical items and unusual mounts.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Rare:</span> these items are limited to a maximum of one per 2500 Army Points (rounding fractions up).<br><i>For example, at 4000 Army Points, Rare items are restricted to Max. 2/army)</i>.<br>Monsters, elite knights and powerful war machines usually follow this limit.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Extraordinary:</span> these items are limited to a maximum of one per 5000 Army Points (rounding fractions up).<br><i>For example, at 4000 Army Points, Extraordinary items are restricted to Max. 1/army)</i>.<br>Army defining entries generally follow this limit, such as magical altars, faction unique upgrades and the most ancient of dragons.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Legendary:</span> these items can only ever be taken once per army.<br><br>Most magic items, the Battle Standard Bearer and the general follow this limit.<br>\t<br>\t<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Max. X combined items per army:</span> some combinations of items may be restricted in combination. In these cases this will be detailed in the Army Organisation part of the Army Book.<br>This is usually units that can have a Character mounted on them or not, or it is a unit with a shooting and melee variant.<br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Max. X items per unit:</span> some items have a maximum limitation allowed per unit. This means you can choose to include up to X instances of these items (mounts, upgrades, etc.) for each unit.<br>\t<br><br>0.75orcKing.png<br><br>/subsubsection{spell_selection}",

In this case, a longbow’s 30\" range translates to 45 metres.<br>You can also draw inspiration from history, seeing 1\" as 10 metres instead. This gives the longbow a range of 300 metres: a standard battlefield of 72×48\" table would then represent a real life area of 720×480 m, or roughly 50 football pitches. In medieval times, this would represent a battlefield where two forces with soldiers numbering from a few hundred to several thousand could meet.<br>\t<br>The rules often refer to things being within a certain distance. When measuring distances, the closest points between objects are used, even if there are intervening elements.<br>Models or units are considered within range if the distance between their closest points is less than or equal to the given range.<br>Measurements are taken from and to the <span class=\"textbf\">Unit Boundary</span> of a unit (i.e. not necessarily the actual models).<br><br>Players are free to measure any distance at any time.<br><br><h5>Range</h5><br>Some effects, such as spells or shooting weapons, have a Range value (X\").

This includes, but is not limited to, the battlefield dimensions, weapon and spell ranges, Mobility and Charge values, base sizes, area of effects, and more.

After nine long ages of strife, the many peoples and kingdoms of this high fantasy world have acquired highly developed and often spectacular methods of waging war. With so many great and terrible powers throughout the lands, the future is poised and uncertain: Everything could be decided on the outcome of a single battle.<br><br>For the reader who wishes to delve deeper into the lore of the Ninth Age, you can discover more of the wider setting in each Army Book, as well as our background-focused publications: <a href='https://www.the-ninth-age.com/the-world/'>the-ninth-age.com/the-world</a>.<br><br>Among the various cultures, countries, and strange dominions of the world, sixteen great factions are pre-eminent. Each of these powers represents a terrifying military force. Each will attempt to dominate the Ninth Age as they are able, and each has connections that can bring it across the globe. As such, there is never any shortage of reasons for conflict and battle between these mighty armies - as your tabletop games can testify.<br><br>Few individuals have the chance to see more than a fraction of our world, with its astonishing variety of intelligent races and animal species, plants and cities, cults and wars. I have travelled from Avras to the Kingdom of Vanhu. I’ve seen Sunna’s seeds planted in Virentia and the Great Wall of Tsuandan in the far east of Augea. You could not find another who has travelled a greater distance; I have been protected by the auspice of Sunna, and here I record my knowledge on the geography of our world.<br>Vetia is the land of mankind, where nations of men have reigned for years under the protective sight of the Goddess and her church. There, the powerful nation of Sonnstahl guards all mankind against the dangers of the Wasteland, while to the south the merchant cities of Arcalea ply their trade with the whole of the world. There you will also find the White Mountains, impenetrable hold of the Dwarves. To the west lie the twin cities of Destria, the Kingdom of noble Equitaine, and the enchanted, emerald-green forest of Wyscan, the mysterious dwelling of the sylvan elves.<br>Augea, the immense sister of Vetia, separated from one another by the great Wasteland, home to the servants of the Dark Gods. Crossing east of Avras into this land, you will travel through the Barren Mountains, where the Steel Road starts its winding journey. Here is the dwelling of the Dwarves of the east, named Infernal. The Steel Road runs parallel to the Silk Road to the north, with access controlled by the Ogre Khans. It leads from the Blasted Plains through the Sky Mountains, across the northern part of the human region of Sagarikadesha, finishing its rich path in the glorious land of Tsuandan, where the Dragon Emperor rules over men.<br>Set sail south from Bellatorre, and in three nights you will reach the docks of Port Reynaud, Equitaine’s holdfast in Taphria. Should you dare it, you will never forget the nights spent in the Great Desert, for they are terrible and fascinating all at once. There, following the path of the Napaat river, lie the remains of a truly ancient kingdom with its legends of never-dying monstrosities. In the west stand the fortresses and souks of Qassar, full of exotic smells and tales of evil spirits, the djinn. In the west and southeast of the continent lie vast kingdoms of men; the Koghi Empire and Kingdom of Vanhu respectively. Finally in its south, the forests around the Mfumu river are said to hide some of the most ancient secrets of the world.<br>The Great Ocean divides Vetia from the two western continents, Silexia in the north and Virentia in the south. The Ocean itself is the dominion of elves: there the fleets of the two great nations, the Highborn and their dreaded kin, vie for supremacy. Here lies the main motherland of the Highborn Elves, the proud islands of Celeda Ablan, and Silexia where freedom is a commodity to be traded.<br>On the eastern coast of Virentia mankind too, has established colonies: the imperial city of Fredericksberg, and the port of Aguadulce, of Destria. Beyond them, a lush forest of wonderful colors and inconceivable dan- gers hides the secrets of ancient civilizations.
